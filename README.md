# :jigsaw: Component-Library
A small component library solo project that is part of the Scrimba Frontend Career Path. The biggest challenge was to get a solid structure for each component as there were no predefined guidelines. Each component is individually customizable via props, e.g. (color, title, text, etc.) 

## :hammer_and_wrench: Main Technologies
* `React`
* `Vite`
* `CSS`
  
## :gear: Features 
 - **Customizable Components:** Each component is customizable via props.
 - **Reusability:** Every component can be reused in multiple places.
